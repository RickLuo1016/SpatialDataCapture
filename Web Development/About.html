            <h1>Theoretical Framework</h1>
            <p>
                Moving from the paradigm of Digital humanity, we introduced our approach on how to define human experience 
                of cultural dataset. In the context of the developed tool we attempted to bridge the scholar field and the 
                cultural institution. The rich variety of conditions influence on the state of the museums in the era of the 
                digital environment. Along with that, the scholar field studying cultural datasets also is  facing various 
                challenges – this is what inspired us to explore the framework of the conducted work.
                </br>
                </br>
                The end of twentieth century is characterized by integration of different types of technologies into a single 
                entity hypermedia. The paradigm of hypermedia assumes the increase of access to new online services for the 
                entire population and in various aspects of life. Thus, the development of technologies contributes to the 
                democratization of digital services. In this context museums around the world continue widely adopting various 
                technologies aimed to increase art accessibility, both on-site located in the museum and online. This new 
                digital reality raises new functionality prescribed for museums. Today Malraux’s “the imaginary museum” obtains 
                new metamorphoses: digitized collections, mobile applications to access digital archives, and omnichannel 
                strategies to communicate this knowledge.
                </br>
                </br>
                While mass digitization of archives takes place, many challenges remain in these research field, one of which 
                is how to extract and articulate information structures. Another important challenge of studying cultural 
                datasets is to how identify appropriate methods for studying them and how to recognitize patterns in those 
                datasets.
                </br>
                </br>
                Today the rich variety of topographic maps is supplemented by complex semiotics for specific media in order 
                to visualize spatial data. The combination of geospatial communication and the creative process required to 
                understand representation of distorted space. In other words, for maximizing information impact, the 
                cartographic framework for modifying spatial data is not sufficient but requires “creative processes” as 
                complementary basis. Hence, embracing capabilities of  spatial analysis, involving creativity and curiosity 
                new solutions can be created for the field of Digital humanity that can museums welcome as their new way to 
                engage with the audience.  We believe that the developed tool with enhancing its capabilities has the potential 
                to be replicated for the collections of other museums. By inviting the audience to participate, cultural 
                institutions create a space for a wildly open dialogue related to the subject of the institution. At this stage, 
                inviting to continue explorations of MoMA’s collection on our main webpage.

                    <p>
                        This website is built in fulfilling Spatial Data Capture module final project requirement.
                        The main objective of the website is to investigate trends in country level art creation, 
                        inclusion, color trends per country/decade and global collaboration in art creation using 
                        MoMA’s art collection. The website contains four main features that leverage MoMA’s processed 
                        data set that is uploaded on a UCL server and called using API.

                        The Museum of Modern Art was established 1929, the year it was established. Currently, 
                        MoMA’s evolving collection contains almost 200,000 works from around the world spanning 
                        the last 150 years. The collection includes an ever-expanding range of visual expression, 
                        including painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing, photography, architecture, design, 
                        film, and media and performance art. The website features more than 86,000 artworks and over 
                        26,000 artists (Museum of Modern Art, 2020). Further information about the collection can be 
                        found on the linked page. Further information could be found on MoMA’s website and the collection 
                        webpage.

                        The aim we are perusing placed in the dimension of digital humanities. That means we are reflecting 
                        the purposes of defining patterns in the collection though “creative visualization”. To bridge the 
                        scholar field and the cultural institution, we are setting objectives that allow us to develop MOMA's
